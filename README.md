# Fault-tolerance-and-Distance-Reliability-of-Electric-Imp-802.11b-g-n-Wi-Fi-transceiver
• Implemented a cascaded algorithm [Double precision checksum, Berger code, Byzantine fault tolerance] to increases reliability of the data transfer between Internet of Things (IOT) module and cloud server. • IOT module was built using Arduino Mega and Electric IMP Wi-FI transceiver and plot.ly cloud server setup for storing the data. C and Squirrel language was used for writing embedded and cloud server code. • The results showed that there was a 73.78% increase in successful transmission i.e. from 25.99% (No algorithm) to 99.66% (Cascaded Algorithm) at various distances.
